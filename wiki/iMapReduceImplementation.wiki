#summary An overview of the iMapReduce implementation in Hadoop.

iMapReduce is implemented based on Hadoop 0.19.2 and HOP. According to the iMapReduce idea, what we need to do is 

 # Make task persistent, so that the map/reduce task are always switching its status between working or suspending. As long as there is input coming, the map/reduce tasks start processing them. After finishing processing, they are suspended for the new coming input.





 # Within the same job, connect reduce tasks to map tasks based on some mapping rule (one-to-one or one-to-all).
